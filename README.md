## Project Ideas

### 1. Namespace System Call Restriction

- **Description**: In this project, you will modify the kernel to restrict certain system calls within specific namespaces. For example, you could prevent processes within a given namespace from using the `fork()` system call to spawn new processes.

- **Objective**: Restrict specific system calls (such as `fork()` or `exec()`) in a designated namespace by modifying the kernel.

- **Basic Idea**: The goal is to create a system that allows administrators to block particular system calls within isolated environments, such as containers. This ensures that certain operations, like creating child processes, are not allowed, providing better control over resource usage and enhancing security.

- **Challenge**: The major challenge lies in ensuring that this restriction is enforced only in the target namespace while keeping the system stable and functional for processes outside the namespace. Additionally, the kernel modification should avoid performance degradation and ensure compatibility with existing applications.

- **Example**: Consider a multi-tenant cloud environment where each tenant operates within its own namespace. By blocking the `fork()` system call within these namespaces, the tenants are restricted from creating new processes, thereby limiting potential resource abuse and enhancing security.

### 2. Differentiated System Call Behavior Across Namespaces

- **Description**: This project focuses on modifying system calls to behave differently based on the namespace in which they are invoked. For example, the `open()` system call could grant or deny access to files depending on the namespace context.

- **Objective**: Implement system calls that behave differently depending on the namespace context, allowing for customized policies and access control per namespace.

- **Basic Idea**: Modify system calls like `open()`, `read()`, and `write()` so that they return different results or apply different policies based on the namespace. This can be useful for isolating services, enforcing specific security policies, or applying resource limits to containers or virtual environments.

- **Challenge**: The complexity arises in ensuring the system calls behave correctly in each namespace without introducing errors or inconsistencies. Additionally, implementing these custom behaviors requires in-depth knowledge of the Linux kernel and system call handling.

- **Example**: In namespace A, a process is allowed to access a sensitive configuration file via `open()`, while in namespace B, the same file access is denied based on predefined access policies. This allows administrators to enforce different rules across environments.

### 3. Encrypted Files with System Call Filter

- **Description**: Build a secure file system where files are encrypted and can only be accessed using valid decryption keys. Unauthorized access should be blocked at the system call level, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure even if accessed by an unauthorized process.

- **Objective**: Encrypt files and ensure that access to them requires a decryption key. Unauthorized access attempts are blocked at the system call level (e.g., `open()`, `read()`).

- **Basic Idea**: Implement a system that encrypts files and modifies system calls to check for decryption keys before granting access. Without the key, the system calls fail, effectively protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access or tampering.

- **Challenge**: The main challenge is ensuring that encryption and decryption are seamlessly integrated with system calls while maintaining performance and security. Additionally, preventing unauthorized processes from accessing the keys or bypassing the system calls is crucial.

- **Example**: A file containing financial records is encrypted, and any process attempting to `read()` or `write()` to it must provide a valid decryption key. Without the key, the system denies access, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure even if the file is stolen.

### 4. Checkpointing and Migration of Docker Containers

- **Description**: This project involves creating a system that can checkpoint (save the state) of a running Docker container and migrate it to another machine, where it can be restarted and continue execution.

- **Objective**: Implement a mechanism to checkpoint a Docker container’s state, transfer it to another machine, and resume its execution seamlessly.

- **Basic Idea**: Develop a checkpointing system that saves the complete state of a Docker container (including process memory, file descriptors, etc.). This state is then transferred to another machine where the container can resume execution. This allows containers to be moved between machines without losing their state.

- **Challenge**: One of the key challenges is ensuring compatibility between different machines during the migration process. Additionally, you must handle issues related to process states, memory mapping, and I/O resources to ensure the container can restart seamlessly.

- **Example**: A Docker container running a web server is checkpointed on Machine A. The state is transferred to Machine B, where the container is restarted, and the web server resumes without losing any connections or data.

### 5. Custom File System with Indexed Access

- **Description**: Design and implement a new file system that allows for direct access to records using an index. The file system should allow efficient retrieval of data based on the indexed key, mimicking the behavior of a database but at a lower system level.

- **Objective**: Create a file system where each file is structured into rows and columns, and any column can be accessed directly using an index.

- **Basic Idea**: The file system will organize files in a tabular format, with each record (or row) having an index. Using this index, the system can quickly retrieve records, providing efficient access similar to that of a database system. The index will be implemented at the system call level so that any process can use it.

- **Challenge**: The complexity lies in designing the index structure to ensure fast access and managing the file system's metadata efficiently. Additionally, building this system at the kernel level requires in-depth knowledge of file system internals.

- **Example**: A log file storing web server requests is organized such that each request (row) is indexed by a unique ID. Using the file system’s index, the system can retrieve a specific request instantly by its ID, rather than searching through the entire log file.

### 6. Embedded System Communication with LoRa

- **Description**: Use LoRa (Long Range) communication modules in an embedded system (e.g., Raspberry Pi) to build a low-power communication network. This project focuses on building a network with low memory and resource footprint.

- **Objective**: Set up a communication system using LoRa modules on Raspberry Pi devices to transmit data over long distances with minimal power usage.

- **Basic Idea**: LoRa is a wireless communication technology designed for long-range, low-power communication. This project involves configuring LoRa modules on Raspberry Pi devices to send and receive data. The system will be useful in applications like sensor networks, where low power and long-range communication are critical.

- **Challenge**: The key challenge is managing the low memory footprint and power efficiency on Raspberry Pi. Additionally, optimizing the LoRa communication protocol to work reliably over long distances is crucial.

- **Example**: A set of Raspberry Pi devices with LoRa modules are deployed in a remote agricultural field. They communicate sensor data (e.g., soil moisture levels) over long distances to a central node without relying on cellular or Wi-Fi networks.

### 7. Geo-Location-Based Service Blocking on Mobile Devices

- **Description**: Build a mobile system that restricts certain services (such as data access, apps, or notifications) based on the user's geographical location. This project can be used to block distractions (e.g., social media) when in certain locations (e.g., a classroom).

- **Objective**: Implement a system that restricts access to certain mobile services when the device enters a predefined geographical area.

- **Basic Idea**: By leveraging the GPS system on mobile devices, this project aims to build a service that automatically disables or limits access to specific apps or system functions based on the device's location. For example, apps like YouTube or Facebook could be restricted in classrooms or libraries.

- **Challenge**: Handling the continuous GPS tracking without significantly draining the device’s battery and ensuring accurate location detection. Additionally, preventing users from bypassing these restrictions would be a critical part of the solution.

- **Example**: When a user enters a university classroom, the system automatically blocks access to social media apps and limits notifications to ensure a distraction-free environment.

### 8. Sensitive Data Protection on Mobile Devices

- **Description**: Develop a mobile security system that ensures sensitive data cannot be transmitted or accessed without proper encryption keys or permissions. This prevents data leaks from mobile devices.

- **Objective**: Prevent any sensitive data (e.g., photos, documents, messages) from being accessed or transmitted without proper authorization, using encryption and permission management.

- **Basic Idea**: Create a mobile system where sensitive data is encrypted, and access or transmission is only allowed with valid keys or permissions. This could involve modifying system-level APIs to check for encryption keys before data is accessed or sent over the network.

- **Challenge**: Implementing a secure encryption system and ensuring that all possible routes of data access (including system-level calls, file managers, and network services) are protected from unauthorized access.

- **Example**: A user's photos are encrypted, and any attempt to upload or share them requires the user to input a valid decryption key. Without the key, the photos cannot be accessed or transmitted.

### 9. Kernel System Call Customization Using Wrappers

- **Description**: This project focuses on modifying system calls using custom wrappers to change their behavior. The goal is to alter the default functionality of system calls, potentially adding extra checks or modifying the way resources are accessed.

- **Objective**: Customize system calls using kernel wrappers to change their default behavior based on specific conditions or user-defined rules.

- **Basic Idea**: Create wrapper functions around existing system calls (e.g., `read()`, `write()`, `exec()`) to add custom logic, such as additional security checks or resource usage tracking. These wrappers intercept the system call and can modify its inputs or outputs.

- **Challenge**: Ensuring that the wrapper functions do not introduce instability or performance bottlenecks. Additionally, the challenge lies in handling edge cases where the system call might behave differently under various conditions.

- **Example**: A wrapper around the `exec()` system call is created to log all executed commands to a file, adding an extra layer of auditing for security purposes. Alternatively, a wrapper for `write()` could ensure that certain sensitive files cannot be modified without explicit authorization.

## 10. Process Scheduling Visualization Tool

- **Description**: Build a graphical tool that visualizes process scheduling in real-time, showing how different processes are managed by the OS scheduler.

- **Objective**: Create a tool that visualizes how the OS scheduler manages multiple processes in real-time, displaying process states (e.g., running, waiting, terminated) and context switching.

- **Basic Idea**: The tool will interface with the system's process management functions, capture scheduling events, and display them in a user-friendly graphical interface. This can help users better understand how process scheduling works under different algorithms like Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, or Multi-level Queue Scheduling.

- **Challenge**: Capturing real-time scheduling events without adding significant overhead to the system. Additionally, visualizing complex scheduling events while ensuring that the data displayed is accurate and easy to understand.

- **Example**: A GUI displays a timeline of processes, showing when each process is running, waiting, or terminated, along with context switches. Users can switch between different scheduling algorithms (e.g., FIFO, Round Robin) to see how they affect process scheduling.

## 11. Dynamic Priority Adjustment for System Processes

- **Description**: Implement a dynamic system where process priorities are adjusted automatically based on system metrics (e.g., CPU usage, I/O wait time).

- **Objective**: Modify the Linux kernel to dynamically adjust process priorities based on real-time system conditions, optimizing for performance.

- **Basic Idea**: The system monitors resource usage and dynamically boosts or reduces process priorities based on metrics like CPU, memory, and I/O usage. For example, CPU-intensive processes may have their priorities lowered during high load, while I/O-bound processes could be given a higher priority.

- **Challenge**: Balancing dynamic priority changes without creating priority inversion or performance bottlenecks. Additionally, the system must ensure that priority changes do not destabilize critical system processes.

- **Example**: During a CPU-intensive task like video encoding, the priority of the encoding process is reduced to allow other I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file transfers) to run faster. When the system is idle, the encoding process gets a priority boost to maximize CPU utilization.

## 12. Real-Time Intrusion Detection System at System Call Level

- **Description**: Build an intrusion detection system (IDS) that monitors system calls in real-time to detect potentially malicious activities.

- **Objective**: The goal is to build a lightweight IDS that monitors system calls made by various processes, flags suspicious behavior, and potentially prevents attacks like buffer overflows, privilege escalation, or malicious code injection.

- **Basic Idea**: The IDS will monitor system calls like `execve()`, `open()`, and `read()` in real-time. It will analyze patterns of these calls and flag anomalies (e.g., excessive calls from an unknown process) as potential security threats. You can also define a whitelist/blacklist of specific system calls that should or shouldn't be executed by certain processes.

- **Challenge**: Real-time monitoring must be efficient and non-intrusive. Ensuring that the detection system does not slow down normal process operations is key. Also, defining thresholds or rules to avoid false positives is critical.

- **Example**: A process tries to execute a system call to access a restricted part of the filesystem. The IDS detects this unauthorized access attempt, flags it as suspicious, and either logs the event or terminates the process.

## 13. Kernel-Level Resource Allocation Optimizer

- **Description**: Implement a kernel module that dynamically allocates resources like CPU, memory, and I/O bandwidth based on workload profiles.

- **Objective**: The aim is to build a kernel-level resource allocator that optimizes system performance by dynamically adjusting resource allocations according to real-time workload profiles and system usage.

- **Basic Idea**: The kernel module will periodically monitor system resources and workloads, reallocating resources to different processes based on predefined rules or real-time analysis. For instance, memory-intensive applications might get higher memory allocation, while compute-bound processes could be given more CPU cycles.

- **Challenge**: Balancing resource allocation in a way that doesn't starve critical system processes or cause instability. The allocator should work efficiently across different types of workloads without introducing significant overhead.

- **Example**: During a period of high disk I/O, the kernel module shifts CPU resources away from CPU-bound processes to ensure that disk operations complete faster. When the I/O-bound tasks complete, the resources are reallocated to the CPU-bound tasks to optimize throughput.

---

## 14. User-Space File System (FUSE)

- **Description**: Create a custom file system in user space using the FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) framework.

- **Objective**: Implement a fully functional file system that operates entirely in user space, allowing experimentation with file system features without needing to modify the kernel.

- **Basic Idea**: You will use FUSE to create a new type of file system that operates at the user level. You can define custom behavior for file operations like reading, writing, and deleting files. For instance, you can create a file system that encrypts all file contents or compresses files automatically.

- **Challenge**: Ensuring efficient file access without significant performance degradation. You also need to handle typical file system operations like caching, error handling, and user permissions correctly.

- **Example**: A FUSE-based file system where all files are automatically compressed when written to the disk. When the user reads a file, it is transparently decompressed before being served to the user.

---

## 15. Kernel-Level System Call Logger

- **Description**: Implement a kernel module that logs all system calls made by user-space processes, including information about the calling process, the system call made, and its parameters.

- **Objective**: The goal is to create a module that helps in debugging and analyzing the behavior of applications by logging system call activity.

- **Basic Idea**: Modify the Linux kernel to insert hooks into the system call table. For each system call, the logger captures details such as the process ID, the system call number, and the arguments passed to it. This information is logged to a file or sent to the console.

- **Challenge**: Ensuring the logger does not introduce significant overhead or affect the stability of the kernel. Additionally, the logger should handle high call volumes without missing data.

- **Example**: A process makes repeated `open()` calls to access files. The logger captures these calls, logs the process ID, and records the path of each file being accessed, which can be useful for auditing or debugging.
